# `fart-2d-geom`

2-dimensional geometry algorithms built on top of the `euclid` crate for
`fart`. Including, but not limited to:

* Polygons
  * Generate a random polygon (surprisingly harder than it sounds)
  * Triangulation
* Convex polygons
  * Convex hull of a set of points
* Lines and line segments
  * Is a point left, right, or on the line?
  * Do two lines intersect?
